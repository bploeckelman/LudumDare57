# Captain N(ostalgia) Ô∏è#

Ever-unfolding horrors of modern life got you down? Captain Nostalgia to the rescue!

Take a trip down memory lane, when times were simpler and games were fun (albeit unforgiving).

Play as a middle-aged man who revisits the gaming adventures of his youth - but things are not always as we remember them. 

Sometimes things get mixed up

Conquer your gaming heroes and take their powers as you confront the real challenge: nostalgia's gentle mourning.
